# Running Race Example

## Intro
This sample demonstrates interop. We model a running race in three UML editors: MagicDraw, Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF), and Papyrus. We show that all UML models transform to the same ES model descriptor. Our model is based on one of the examples from MarkLogic's Entity Services github: <https://github.com/marklogic/entity-services/tree/master/entity-services-examples/example-races/>. 

## Models
Here is the MagicDraw model:

![RunningRace](../umlModels/RunningRace.png)

Here is the EMF model:

![RunningRaceEMF](../umlModels/RunningRaceEMF.png)

The Eclipse project is in data/RunningRaceEMF. If you would like to view/edit it in Eclipse, import both this project and the profile Eclipse project at [../umlProfile/eclipse/MLProfileProject](../../umlProfile/eclipse/MLProfileProject).

Here is the Papyrus model:

![RunningRacePapyrus](../umlModels/RunningRacePapyrus.png)

The Eclipse project is in data/RunningRacePapyrus. If you would like to view/edit it in Eclipse, import both this project and the profile Eclipse project at [../umlProfile/eclipse/MLProfileProject[(../../umlProfile/eclipse/MLProfileProject).

## How to run:

Our project uses gradle. Before running, view the settings in gradle.properties. Create a file called gradle-local.properties and in this file override any of the properties from gradle.properties.

Here are the steps to setup.

### Setup DB
Setup new DB. Will use basic DB config with no indexes. Will bring in XMI2ES transform to our modules.

Run the following:

./gradlew  -i setup mlDeploy

Confirm:
- New DB and app server created with name xmi2es-examples-runningRace.

### Transform UML to ES

Now we deploy our three running race UML models. They end up as Entity Services models in MarkLogic! 

First, the MagicDraw model:

./gradlew -i -b uml2es.gradle -PmodelFile=../umlModels/RunningRace.xml uDeployModel

Next the EMF and Papyrus models:

./gradlew -i -b uml2es.gradle  -PmodelFile=data/RunningRaceEMF/model/RunningRaceEMF.uml uDeployModel

./gradlew -i -b uml2es.gradle  -PmodelFile=data/RunningRacePapyrus/RunningRacePapyrus.uml uDeployModel

Confirm:
- Content DB includes several documents created when loading the XMI files, including:
	* /marklogic.com/entity-services/models/RunningRace.json - ES model based on MagicDraw UML model
	* /marklogic.com/entity-services/models/RunningRaceEMF.json - ES model based on EMF UML model
	* /marklogic.com/entity-services/models/RunningRacePapyrus.json - ES model based on Papyrus UML model
	* /xmi2es/findings/RunningRace.xml - findings during the transform from MagicDraw to ES
	* /xmi2es/findings/RunningRaceEMF.xml - findings during the transform from EMF to ES
	* /xmi2es/findings/RunningRacePapyrus.xml - findings during the transform from Papyrus to ES

Check each of the findings documents: /xmi2es/findings/RunningRace.xml, /xmi2es/findings/RunningRaceEMF.xml, /xmi2es/findings/RunningRacePapyrus.xml. Verify there are no issues reported in any of them.

## Check Model Differences
In Query Console, import XMI2ESRunningRace.xml workspace. In the tab entitled Check Diff, run to confirm the models are the same.
